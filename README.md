# Cuda accelerated kernel image processing

An hardware accelerated implementation of kernel image processing (or convolution), in Python and PyCuda with CUDA C kernel.

This implementation was compared with a pure python sequential approach, and the filter2D function provided by OpenCV.

This project was carried out as part of the Parallel Programming for Machine Learning course, at the Universit√† degli studi di Firenze.
